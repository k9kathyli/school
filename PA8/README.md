# Programming Assignment 8

Programming Assignment 8 is the conclusion of the Pac-Man game assignments, in which a simplified game of Pac-Man has real visuals added and is played in a separate window rather than in the terminal. This assignment introduces us to JavaFX, which is the standard GUI library for Java. 

To run on Windows command prompt: 
- Make sure that JavaFX is downloaded: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
- Add an environment variable with `set PATH_TO_FX="path\to\javafx-sdk-14\lib"` (modify path as needed)
- Compile with `javac --module-path %PATH_TO_FX% --add-modules javafx.controls GuiPacman.java`
- Run with `java --module-path %PATH_TO_FX% --add-modules javafx.controls GuiPacman`
